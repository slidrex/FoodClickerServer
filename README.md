FoodClicker is a new perspective on the clicker genre.
It is a server based game that is designed to be secure in terms
of game progress. Lots of cosmetics and prestige dependent content.

Serverside Feature
=
There is a Leaderboard mechanic that will make you choose between two things:
To upgrade prestige and be erased out of leaderboard in order to get into leaders soon
with new prestige level or better earn plenty of money that will help you to stay in leaders
but with zero prestige level. 
FoodClicker will try to make game progress impossible to hack. It means that all your progress,
cosmetics and big production levels is a result of hard and long work.
Also, as every player has a profile with registration date you may estimate the time that player spend
on making their progress. 
Most of this serverside stuff done for one important thing: Progress and rare event items are real and
belong to a existing human without cheating.

Unique features
=
Unlike all clickers, FoodClicker is not designed to be AFK Farm game in which you just need to have
keep your device and game turned on. Instead, it will try to make gameplay as various and dependent on player
in-game not afk actions. (Some of basic staff that is planning to be implemented but not now is online player battles and some random-based mechanics
that will make a game more interesting and different).
FoodClicker already has a detailed cosmetics system with backgrounds and food you click to make progress with prestige-based items which
you will be able to get only if you reset your progress and start a new game from scratch.
